### *1. Transportation*  
 - **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Find the shortest route between two points in a city's transportation network.  
 - **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Design an efficient road network by finding the minimum spanning tree of connected intersections.
 - **BFS/DFS**: Traverse through routes to detect congested areas or alternate paths.
 - **Heap**: Manage priority queues for traffic signal optimization and emergency vehicle routing.
 -  **Union-Find (Disjoint Sets)**: Track connected roads and highways to monitor accessibility during maintenance or natural disasters.
